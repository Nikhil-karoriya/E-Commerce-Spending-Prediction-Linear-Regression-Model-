# E-Commerce-Spending-Prediction-Linear-Regression-Model-
This is a Linear Regression model which predicts how much a user spends every year in an e-commerce website on the basis of user's characteristics.

## About the Model :
For this Project I have used Linear Regression Model, Implemented by Myself using Numpy, Pandas & Matplotlib, to make predictions about data and analysed the predictions with actual values of data.

## Objective of the project:
Given a dataset of an imaginary Company which is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website. We have to help them make a data-driven decision.

## What is the Data in the Project?
In this project we work with a dataset [available on kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iyadavvaibhav/ecommerce-customer-device-usage).
The data includes information about customers of an e-commerce website, including the following:

Avg. Session Length: Average session of in-store style advice sessions.
Time on App: Average time spent on App in minutes
