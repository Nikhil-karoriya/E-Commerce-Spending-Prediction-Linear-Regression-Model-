# E-Commerce-Spending-Prediction-Linear-Regression-Model-

## Objective of the project:
  Given a dataset of an imaginary Company which is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience/ website experience. We have to help them make a data-driven decision.

## About the Model :
  This model predicts how much a user would spend every year on an e-commerce website on the basis of user's characteristics as measured from the given data.
  Linear Regression algorithm is used for implementing the model using python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas & Matplotlib, to make predictions about data.
  Model predictions are then evaluated with the actual values of data.

## What is the Data in the Project?
  In this project we work with a dataset [available on kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iyadavvaibhav/ecommerce-customer-device-usage).
  The data includes information about customers of an e-commerce website of a company, including the following:
  
          Avg. Session Length: Average session of in-store style advice sessions.
          Time on App: Average time spent on App in minutes
          Time on Website: Average time spent on Website in minutes
          Length of Membership: How many years the customer has been a member.
